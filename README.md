# Diabetes-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. Four models are implemented and compared to determine the best performing a
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression

 
The goal is to understand and evaluate the performance of these models for accurate diabetes prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains medical data, including features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more, with a target variable indicating diabetes diagnosis.

## Models and Comparison
1. **Decision Tree**: A tree-based algorithm that splits the data into subsets based on feature thresholds.
2. **KNN**: A distance-based algorithm that predicts the class based on the majority class of k nearest neighbors.
3. **Logistic Regression**: A probabilistic model suitable for binary classification tasks.
4. **Linear Regression**: Used here for demonstration, though more suited for regression tasks.

The models are trained and tested, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
